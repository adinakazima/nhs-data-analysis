# NHS Healthcare Data Analysis

This project was completed as part of my Data Science coursework for my Computer Science with AI degree. It focuses on leveraging NHS healthcare data 
to uncover insights that can improve patient care and support data-driven decision-making by hospital administrators, policymakers, and medical professionals.

## Key Features

- **Domain Analysis**: Explored the NHS business domain to understand challenges faced, and identified how data science solutions could help with this.  
- **Database Design**: Built and normalized a healthcare database in SQLite from disparate, unnormalized CSV files. Produced an ER diagram and documented the normalization process.  
- **Solution 1**: Applied logistic regression to predict patient readmissions.  
- **Solution 2**: Compared NHS and private hospital surgery outcomes using Chi-Square Test.  
- **Solution 3**: Applied K-means clustering to segment patient profiles, indentifying high-risk patients.
- **Visualisations**: Designed clear charts and graphs to communicate findings effectively. 
- **Ethics and Analysis**: Reflected on ethical implications and challenges associated with the solutions.   

## Tools & Libraries
- Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- DB Browser for SQLite  

## Notes
- The original database and raw data are not included due to size and confidentiality restrictions.  
- Sample outputs and results are documented in the notebook.
